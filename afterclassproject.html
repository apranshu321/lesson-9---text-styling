<p>Chess is a board game for two players.
     It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess).

    Chess is an abstract strategy game which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance.
     It is played on a square game board called a chessboard containing 64 squares arranged in an 8by8 grid.
      The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.
       White moves first, followed by Black; then moves alternate. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king.
        There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
    
    The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga,
     in seventh-century India. After its introduction in Persia, it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe.
      The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century.
       Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, with millions of players worldwide.
    
    Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs;
     the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz,
      claimed his title in 1886; Gukesh Dommaraju is the current World Champion (2024).
    
    A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception.
     Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and the arts,
      and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.
       One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine.
        In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov.
         Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory;
          however, chess is not a solved game.</p>
